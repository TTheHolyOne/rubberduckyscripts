    <h1>All of my rubber ducky scripts!</h1>
	  <h3>Go to <a href="https://ducktoolkit.com/userscripts">HERE</a> to use the scripts( also need to buy a rubber ducky from hak5.org )</h3>
	  <p>About:<br/>Rubber Ducky is a USB that can run scripts with Ducky Language<br/>This usb acts like a keyboard and the computer think its a keyboard but t can run<br/>malicious scripts with it<br/>This is another reason why you shouldn't plug in random USBS you find in places!</p>
